If downloading all files to an IDE, simply click run and follow the menu options for the default array imported from "array.txt".

Otherwise ArrayOfIntegers.h, ArrayOfIntegers.cpp and "array.txt" are required.
I) Add arrayMain() to main.
II) #include "ArrayOfIntegers.h"
III) If you prefer to use a different text file of integers, change [string file] in [void arrayMain()] to the file name of your choice where "array.txt" exists. 
IV) You must also change [int arraySize] based on the number of integers in your file.
V) Run the program
VI) Choose the options available
    1) Search if number exists and return the index
    2) Modify an integer based on index chosen
    3) Add new integer to the end of the array
    4) Provide index to remove from array
    0) Quit
